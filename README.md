# Learning Python and OOPs concepts

These are my exercises in learning programming for the first time.

I chose IPython Notebook to use for all my practice and save them here for me to be able to work in the same folder from two locations.

As these are very basic OOPs exercises, anybody of my level, the very beginners can check them out if useful.
