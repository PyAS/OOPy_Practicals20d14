All the '.ipynb' files I added here are IPython Notebook files. 

If you are new to Python, IPython, Notebook or even github, or all of them like me, there is one thing to note.

Click on each file on this GUI or even after downloading them locally, you will only see them as JSOn files.

Take the url of any of these files and paste them in the search bar of http://nbviewer.ipython.org and hit enter.

This will open up the actual work I did, but that cannot be edited. It is only for viewing. 

But if you open these ipynb files locally after downloading, using the command on terminal, 'ipython notebook filename.ipynb':
	this will open up on your local server editable. I hope I know what I am talking about.

These are my exercises while learning programming for the first time.

I chose IPython Notebook to use for all my practise and save them here for me to be able to work in the same folder from two locations.

I mean using simply all that GitHub features.

As these are very basic OOPs exercises I am trying to achieve in Python, anybody of my level, the very beginners can check them out if useful.
