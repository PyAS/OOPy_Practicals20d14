These are my exercises while learning programming for the first time.

I chose IPython Notebook to use for all my practise and save them here for me to be able to work in the same folder from two locations.

I mean using simply all that GitHub features.

As these are very basic OOPs exercises I am trying to achieve in Python, anybody of my level, the very beginners can check them out if useful.
