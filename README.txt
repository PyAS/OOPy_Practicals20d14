These are my exercises while learning programming for the first time.

I chose to use IPython Notebook to use for all my practise and save them here for me to be able to work on the same files from two locations.

As these are very basic OOPs exercises I am trying to achieve in Python, anybody of my level, the very beginners can check them out if useful.
